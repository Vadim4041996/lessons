                        Тахти. Тахта - це одна з варіацій дивана, але стильніша і мінімалістична. Виглядають тахти дуже незвично і можуть підійти для будь-якого інтер'єру. Також тахти більше ніж звичайні дивани підходять для сну, оскільки в їх основі не пружинні блоки, а дерев'яні ламелі або ортопедичні матраци;

                        Armchairs A sofa is one of the variations of a sofa, but it is more stylish and minimalistic. The ottomans look very unusual and can be suitable for any interior. Also, ottomans are more suitable for sleeping than ordinary sofas, since they are not based on spring blocks, but on wooden slats or orthopedic mattresses;

                        A set of furniture. A set of upholstered furniture is an excellent solution for those who want to furnish their living room not only with a sofa, but also with armchairs. There are sets with one or two armchairs, with straight or corner sofas. The main advantage of any ready-made furniture set is that the pieces of furniture in it are perfectly combined with each other, and you will not need to spend your time and energy on their selection.
